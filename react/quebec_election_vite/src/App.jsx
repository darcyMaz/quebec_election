/*
So I want to have the main page be a map of quebec on the left with many images inside of it of the different regions.
And each picture links you to the page with the hexagon ridings.
Each picture is a small picture of the hexagon riding page I think.
On the right is the main results and on hover, shows info about a regions results.

Ok so I should make the main page for the heck of it I suppose.
Also gotta figure out how to move between diff pages lol, after after
